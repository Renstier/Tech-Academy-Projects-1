# CarlsCarQuotes
This was one of my finals for C# at The Tech Academy, building website with
MVC to process car insurance quotes based on a number of factors including
age, speeding tickets, make and model of car, and more. I'm glad I got the 
opportunity to work with both database-first and code-first approaches over
the course of my education, it's always good to have as many techniques as
possible for implementing solutions.
