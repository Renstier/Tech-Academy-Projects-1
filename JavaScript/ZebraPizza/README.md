# ZebraPizza
This was the main project for the JavaScript course at The Tech Academy, building a crude pizza 
"ordering" system to calculate the price while factoring in different topping options, pizza 
sizes, ect. This was a fun little exercise that taught me some of the basics of JavaScript, I'll 
be working on some more advanced JavaScript projects soon!
